## Refik

### Black&White Image Colorization

- There are multiple versions of this topic with implementations
- Dataset is easy to create.
- [One of the famous project](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/])

### Fast Neural Style

- [Implementation with paper](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style)

### Autonomous Car (Experimental Idea)

- Driving autonomous car with using a simulation
- [Example Simulation Tool](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)
- [Euro Truck Simulator Hack](https://github.com/aleju/self-driving-truck)
- [GTA 5 Hack](https://github.com/aitorzip/DeepGTAV)
- [Twitch Stream(Seems offline)](https://www.twitch.tv/sentdex)



### GAN for X

- X can be any image topic
- For example: Celebrity Images (~SOTA) [Progressive GANs](http://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-10_Progressive-Growing-of)

### Few Shot Learning 

- This happens where the data size is limited per class.
- References. TODO
